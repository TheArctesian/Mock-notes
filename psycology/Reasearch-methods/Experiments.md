    <td>Experiments preformed in a controlled environment using standardized procedures with participants randomly allocated to experimental groups </td>
    <td>

- Hight degree of control
  - Experimenters control all vars and the IV and DV are precisely operationalized and measured leading to greater accuracy and objectivity.
- Replication
  - Other researchers can repeat the experiment
- Cause and effect
  - As All vars are controlled the effect (Î”DV) must be caused solely by the manipulation of the IV
- Isolation of Var
  - In the lab, individual pieces of behavior can be isolated and rigorously tested </td>
  <td>
  
- Experimenter Bias
  - Experimenter's expectations can affect results and participants may be influenced by these expectations
- Problems Operationalizing IV & DV
  - To gain precision, measurements can become too specific and not relate to wider behavior; for example, defining 'getting fatter' as putting 2 kg on in a week
- Low ecological validity
  - High degrees of control make experimental situations artificial and unlike real life. Therefore, it can be difficult to generalize results to other settings.
- Demand Characteristic  
 - Participants are aware they are being tested and so may unconsciously alter their behavior
