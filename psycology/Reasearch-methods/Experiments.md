- Hight degree of control  
    - Experimenters control all vars and the IV and DV are precisely operationalized and measured leading to greater accuracy and objectivity. 
- Replication  
    - Other researchers can repeat the experiment  
- Cause and effect 
    - As All vars are controlled the effect (Î”DV) must be caused solely by the manipulation of the IV  
- Isolation of Var  
    - In the lab, individual pieces of behavior can be isolated and rigorously tested  </td>
